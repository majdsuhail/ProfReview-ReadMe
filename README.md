# ProfeReview
### This repository was created as a documentation to explain how the platform (profreview.net) works and showcase its features. The main project is in a private repository for security reasons, so i created this one for the ReadMe.md file.
## The project is live on [profreview.net](https://profreview.net/)

### Breif description:
Profreview is a platform dedicated to enhancing the academic experience for both students and professors. It allows university students to rate and review their professors, providing valuable feedback that helps professors improve their teaching and students make informed decisions.

# The Platform's Features:
* It has a public access mode which is viewed as a **read-only** for any public visitor and doesn't require a login/signup. The public access shows the universities available on the platform, each professor and their details(Name, Image, Email, office location, and office phone number), and the reviews and ratings made by the students for each professor in the selected university.

‚ùó*** The platform allows only the students from the same university to login/signup to the university's **editing/writing mode**(for example: Bilgi university editing/writing mode can be accessed only with emails that end with the @bilgiedu.net domain, and so on for other univeristies) to ensure authenticity***

### In the editing mode students can: 
* Rate(using a five star system) and write reviews for any professor(**Anonymous review submission is supported**)
* Delete and Update their rating and reviews(after submission)
* Like reviews(students who find a review helpful can like other student's reviews(they can remove their like at any time)
* Report offensive or inappropriate Reviews by other students and moderators will notice and act accordingly if applicable
![]()
* Add missing professors from the selected university (example: professors that are newly joined to the university, do not exist on the platform, or were not added to the database before, etc..). The process of submitting a new professor to the database requires the student to input the professor's full or partial info(Name, Image, Email, office location, and office phone number) through the platform and submit for review by the moderators

### Student's account profile:

* Students can delete or logout from their account from the profile page.
* Students are also able to remove their professor submissions but only if a submission is still pending
